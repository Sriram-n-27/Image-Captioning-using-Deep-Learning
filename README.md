# Image-Captioning-using-Deep-Learning
The model generates a caption for the input image, using CV and NLP. 

The dataset used is **Flickr8k** and framworks used are **TensorFlow** and **Keras**. We use **VGG16** (CNN) to extract the features of the image and RNN to generate the caption, one single word at a time. 
Finally, we use **BLEU** metric to evaluate our model.
